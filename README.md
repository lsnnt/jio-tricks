# jio-tricks
this is a repository to bypass jio restrictions and stream
# jiosaavn
Get the song url of jiosaavn using `lite.duckduckgo.com` after your 100% jio data quota exhausted and use jiosaavn.go build it using go and use it as ```./jiosaavn --url <url of song jiosaavn here>``` or you can also use ```go build jiosaavn.go --url <url of song jiosaavn here>``` and the url the script will generate will be used to stream music even after data quota exhausted.
It will work on mobile
If it not works in your computer 
add ```2405:200:1609:1731::312c:8a8b aac.saavncdn.com``` in ```/etc/hosts```

### more project info
This project is made possible because i found that certain cdn url and some other url can be used at full speed even after full 100% data quota exhaustion so in this case i made this project
